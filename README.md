## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require omaralalwi/laravel-trash-cleaner
```

### Publishing Configuration File

Optionally, you can publish the package's configuration file to customize the cleanup schedule and other settings:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Omaralalwi\LaravelTrashCleaner\Providers\LaravelTrashCleanerServiceProvider" --tag=config
```

## Usage

Run the following command to clear all log and debug files (safely):

```bash
php artisan trash:clean
```

After publishing, you can find the configuration file at `config/laravel-trash-cleaner.php`. Modify the `'schedule'` and `'frequency'` options as needed to automate the cleanup process.

### Scheduling the Cleanup Job

To schedule the cleanup job, ensure that the `'schedule'` option in the `laravel-trash-cleaner.php` configuration file is set to `true`, and specify the desired `'frequency'` (e.g., `'daily'`, `'weekly'`). The package automatically registers the cleanup command with Laravel's task scheduler when the application boots.
